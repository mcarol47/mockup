            <p>A (modular, highly tweakable) responsive one-page template.</p>
            <p>This is a Banner element, and it's generally used as an introduction or opening statement. You can
                customize
                its style, scheme, color, size, orientation, content alignment, and image position, as well as assign it
                an
                optional onload or onscroll transition modifier (details).</p>

            <h2>Spotlight</h2>
            <p>This is a Spotlight element, and it's generally used - as its name implies - to spotlight a particular
                feature, subject, or pretty much whatever. You can customize its style, scheme, color, orientation,
                content
                alignment, and image position, as well as assign it an optional onload or onscroll transition modifier
                (details).</p>

            <h2>Spotlight</h2>
            <p>This is also a Spotlight element, and it's here because this demo would look a bit empty with just one
                spotlight. Like all spotlights, you can customize its style, scheme, color, orientation, content
                alignment,
                and image position, as well as assign it an optional onload or onscroll transition modifier (details).

    <div class="spotlight">
        <div class="content">
            <h2>Spotlight</h2>
            <p>And yes, this is another Spotlight element, and it's also here because I need to fill a bit of space.
                Naturally, like any other spotlight, you can customize its style, scheme, color, orientation, content
                alignment, and image position, as well as assign it an optional onload or onscroll transition modifier
                (details).</p>

    </div>

    <div class="gallery">
        <h2>Gallery</h2>
        <p>This is a Gallery element. It can behave as a lightbox (when given the lightbox class), and you can customize
            its style and size, as well as assign it an optional onload or onscroll transition modifier (details).</p>
        <div class="content-container"></div>
